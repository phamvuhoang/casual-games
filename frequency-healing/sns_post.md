## Long-Form Explainer Message - All Configurable Options

**Master Post (Long Version)**
If you are new to Frequency Healing Studio, here is exactly what you can customize so each session matches your state, intention, and energy level.

Start with the listening-first flow. You can open the studio and press Play immediately with Sacred Geometry as the default live visual style, then refine only what you need.

You can build your tone stack in multiple ways:
- Choose preset healing frequencies like 396, 417, 432, 528, 639, 852, and 963 Hz.
- Add your own custom frequency manually (within the supported range).
- Add harmonic layers (2x and 3x) from your selected tones.
- Adjust per-frequency volume so each tone has its own weight in the mix.

You can shape the core sound behavior:
- Waveform selection: sine, triangle, square, sawtooth.
- Mix style: manual selected tones or golden ladder mode for richer harmonic texture.
- Ambient layer: none, rain, ocean, forest, or bells.
- Session duration and master volume.

You can fully customize visualization:
- Visualization modes: waveform, particles, mandala, spiral, gradient, ripple, sacred_geometry, multi-layer, orbital.
- For multi-layer mode, add/remove/reorder layers and toggle each layer on/off.
- Per-layer controls: blend mode, opacity, intensity, speed, scale.
- Per-layer color controls: color A, B, C.

You can add movement and entrainment:
- Rhythm engine: enable/disable, BPM, subdivision, and editable step pattern (with randomize).
- Modulation: enable LFO, set waveform, rate, and depth.
- Sweep: enable sweep, curve type, target frequency, and sweep duration.
- Binaural mode: enable, set beat offset (Hz), and stereo spread.

You can control live experience and transparency:
- Keep live visualization on or pause it anytime.
- Show or hide session info overlay.
- Include session info in exported visuals so viewers can see frequency stack, rhythm, modulation, sweep, and binaural settings.

You can publish only when you are ready:
- Publishing tools are hidden by default so first-time use stays simple.
- When expanded, you can set title, description, export format, video capture option (device-dependent), and public/private sharing.
- Save and share once your session feels right.

You can also use mobile-friendly controls designed for real meditation moments:
- Persistent bottom controls for quick Play/Stop and instant status.
- Quick jump buttons to frequency stack, live visualization, and publishing.
- Optional mini live dock on mobile so you can always keep visuals in view.

The goal is simple: let you start in seconds, then unlock depth only when you want it. Build a 5-minute reset, a deep focus ritual, or a long wind-down session using the same studio flow.

## Deep-Dive Technical Message - Rhythm, Modulation, Sweep, Binaural, and Golden Ratio Ladder

**Master Post (Very Long Version)**
If you want to understand Frequency Healing Studio beyond surface-level controls, here is a full breakdown of what each advanced option does and how it is modeled internally.

This guide focuses on:
- Rhythm pattern
- Modulation + sweep
- Binaural mode
- Golden ratio ladder (hypothesis + formula)

Use this post when you want to educate your audience, teach intentional usage, or explain why one setting sounds very different from another.

---

### 1) Rhythm pattern: what each control means

Rhythm in this app is not a drum machine. It is a **gating engine** that opens/closes the amplitude of your whole harmonic signal over time.

Available rhythm controls:
- `Enable rhythm`
- `BPM` (range: 35 to 180)
- `Subdivision` (`4n`, `8n`, `16n`, `8t`)
- `Steps` (16-step boolean grid)
- `Randomize` (creates a valid 16-step pattern)

How it behaves internally:
- The app normalizes the step grid to exactly 16 steps.
- At least one step is always active, so you never get total silence by mistake.
- On each step:
  - active step -> gate target = `1`
  - inactive step -> gate target = `0.001` (near-muted, smoother than hard zero)
- Gate transitions use a short smoothing constant (`setTargetAtTime(..., 0.01)`) to avoid clicks.

Interpretation tip:
- Lower BPM + sparse active steps = spacious, breath-like pulses.
- Higher BPM + dense steps = driving texture, more stimulation.
- `8t` can feel more flowing or trance-like due to triplet timing.

Meditation best-practice suggestions:
- For calming or sleep prep:
  - BPM 50-72
  - Subdivision `8n` or `16n`
  - 25%-50% active steps
- For focused work:
  - BPM 65-90
  - Subdivision `16n`
  - regular repeating motifs (not full random)

---

### 2) Modulation + Sweep: what each option means

These are pitch automation tools. They move frequencies continuously over time.

#### Modulation (LFO)

Controls:
- `Enable LFO`
- `LFO waveform`: `sine`, `triangle`, `square`, `sawtooth`
- `Rate (Hz)`: `0.01` to `24`
- `Depth (Hz)`: `0.1` to `220`

Internal model:
- LFO phase:
  - `phase = elapsed * 2π * rateHz`
- LFO output:
  - `sine`: `sin(phase)`
  - `triangle`: `(2/π) * asin(sin(phase))`
  - `square`: `sign(sin(phase))`
  - `sawtooth`: periodic linear ramp in `[-1, 1]`
- Modulation offset:
  - `offsetHz = lfoValue * depthHz`

Practical sound outcomes:
- Sine = smooth organic motion
- Triangle = smooth but more linear rise/fall
- Square = stepped/toggling sensation (can feel sharp)
- Sawtooth = directional sweep feel with harder reset

Best-practice defaults:
- Relaxation:
  - rate 0.05-0.25 Hz
  - depth 2-12 Hz
  - sine/triangle
- Focus:
  - rate 0.08-0.4 Hz
  - depth 1-8 Hz

#### Sweep

Controls:
- `Enable sweep`
- `Curve`: `linear`, `exponential`, `easeInOut`
- `Target Hz` (normalized to valid frequency range)
- `Duration (s)`: `1` to `180`

Important implementation detail:
- Sweep target is computed as a **ratio transform** from the first selected frequency (anchor), not a flat replacement for every tone.

Formula:
- Let:
  - `anchor = firstBaseFrequency`
  - `targetHz = userTarget`
  - `ratio = targetHz / anchor`
- For each voice `i`:
  - `voiceTarget_i = clamp(20, base_i * ratio, 10000)`

Sweep progress:
- `p = min(1, elapsed / durationSeconds)`
- Curve mapping:
  - linear: `s(p) = p`
  - exponential: `s(p) = p^2.2`
  - easeInOut: `s(p) = 0.5 - cos(πp)/2`
- Swept frequency:
  - `f_swept_i = base_i + (voiceTarget_i - base_i) * s(p)`

Combining modulation + sweep:
- Final frequency per voice:
  - `f_i = clamp(20, f_swept_i + offsetHz, 10000)`

This means sweep gives macro movement, modulation adds micro-motion on top.

---

### 3) Binaural mode: what each option means

Binaural mode creates left/right frequency differences intended for headphone listening.

Controls:
- `Enable binaural`
- `Beat offset (Hz)` range: `0.1` to `40`
- `Stereo spread` range: `0.2` to `1.0`

Internal conversion:
- The UI beat value is split into half-offset per ear:
  - `beatOffset = clamp(0.05, beatHz / 2, 20)`
- For each selected base frequency `f`:
  - Left channel frequency: `f_left = max(20, f - beatOffset)`
  - Right channel frequency: `f_right = f + beatOffset`
- Pan values:
  - left pan = `-panSpread`
  - right pan = `+panSpread`
- Each side uses ~65% of per-voice base gain to keep combined loudness stable.

Best-practice guidance:
- Use headphones for true binaural perception.
- Start with beatHz around 4-10 for gentle entrainment-style sessions.
- Keep volume moderate; subtle settings are usually better for long sessions.

Important:
- Binaural mode currently bypasses golden-ladder expansion and uses direct dual-voice splitting from selected base frequencies.

---

### 4) Golden ratio ladder: hypothesis and formula

In this app, golden ladder mode (`golden432`) expands each selected base frequency into a multi-layer harmonic field derived from powers of the golden ratio.

Golden ratio constant:
- `φ = (1 + √5) / 2 ≈ 1.61803398875`

Core hypothesis (wellness framing):
- Some users report that φ-related interval spacing feels less mechanically repetitive and more “organic” than simple integer harmonics.
- In practical UX terms, this can create richer textures with less perceived monotony during longer meditation sessions.
- This is a psychoacoustic/wellness hypothesis, not a medical claim.

Ladder frequency generation:
- For each base frequency `f0` and each ladder power `p`:
  - `f_raw = f0 * φ^p`
  - `f_ladder = normalizeToRange(f_raw, 48, 2200)`
- `normalizeToRange` means:
  - while `f < 48`, multiply by 2
  - while `f > 2200`, divide by 2
- This octave-folding keeps tones in a musically and perceptually useful band.

Current ladder powers and layering:
- Powers used: `[-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, +1, +2, +3]`
- Three `p=0` layers are intentionally used to reinforce the anchor with subtle variations.
- Some center layers include slight detune offsets (`±2.2 cents`) for width.
- Layer pan values alternate left/right across the field for immersion.

Amplitude strategy:
- Final layer gain uses:
  - `volume_final = clamp(0.01, masterVolume * layerGain * groupScale * voiceGain, 0.95)`
- Where:
  - `layerGain` = per-layer predefined weight
  - `voiceGain` = user per-frequency volume setting
  - `groupScale = 1 / sqrt(numberOfSelectedBaseFrequencies)`
- This keeps total energy more stable as you add more base frequencies.

Pan spread by base index:
- If multiple base frequencies are selected, each base gets a slight position spread:
  - `baseSpread = ((index / spacing) * 2 - 1) * 0.18`
- Combined pan:
  - `pan_final = clamp(-1, layerPan + baseSpread, 1)`

Why this matters for user experience:
- You can keep a simple entry experience (one or two frequencies), then switch to golden ladder for cinematic depth.
- The result often feels “bigger” without needing extra UI complexity.
