Just shipped a new AR game, NEON ARC! 🎮✨

It's a browser-based experience where you can create and throw mesh-like energy balls with your bare hands. Powered by Three.js and MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking.

Super excited to share the progress! #BuildInPublic #WebXR #ThreeJS #MediaPipe

Check it out and let me know what you think! 👇
